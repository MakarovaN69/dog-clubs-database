The developed system keeps records of the activities of the cityâ€™s kennel clubs. The system also contains information about dogs, their owners, competitions in which they participate and awards.
The main users of the system are employees of kennel clubs. They enter data about the dogs and their competitions into a database. If necessary, the employee must be able to edit the data. The employee must also have access to data from other tables to generate reports.
Thus, to ensure the operation of kennel clubs, employees must know complete information about the club, dogs, competitions, owners, participations, awards and many additional tables (directories of competition venues, awards, etc.). In this regard, it is possible to characterize the input data of the developed system.
